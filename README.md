Constrain a bone or a set of bones in one click from the automatically generated quick buttons

## Extremely powerful
The addon reads user created constraints in a Json file and adds quick constraint buttons in the animation panel. In one click you can constrain a bone or a set of bones

The addon is extremely powerful and allows you to create all the different constraint types. You are not limited to your character. You can constrain to other objects or even other armatures

## Save your time
The addon supports hotloading. The presets are read everytime the buttons are pressed. You just need to save your JSON file, no extra step is required

## Simple and convenient
The JSON files are tied to the armature names and can be shared between multiple duplicate linked armatures

You can save your presets in a property of your object. That property can  be modified within Blender. This allows sharing the .blend file and its preset without sending the JSON file. 

The support for aliases allows you to share the presets between multiple common rigs without having to make another JSON file. You can just change the bone aliases and the constraints will work for your new rig
